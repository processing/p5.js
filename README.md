# [p5.js](http://p5js.org)

[Hello!](http://hello.p5js.org/) p5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of Processing, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for today's web.

Using the original metaphor of a software sketchbook, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, you're not limited to your drawing canvas, you can think of your whole browser page as your sketch! For this, p5.js has addon libraries that make it easy to interact with other HTML5 objects, including text, input, video, webcam, and sound.

p5.js is a new interpretation, not an emulation or port, and it is in active development. An official editing environment is coming soon, as well as many more features!

If you already know the basics of JavaScript or Processing, the [p5.js overview](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/p5.js-overview) wiki page is a good place to start. The [frequently asked questions](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) might also be helpful.

If you have found a bug in the p5.js library, you can file it here under the [“issues” tab](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues). An indicative template for reporting an issue is provided to assist you (and us!) better.

## p5.js library

To use the complete p5.js library, you can [download it here](http://p5js.org/download). If you are interested in the most recent, less stable version, or even simply in (**new!**) certain components of p5.js, you can clone this repository and run `grunt` from the command line to generate the library from source. See the [development](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Development#Setup) wiki for more information about our build process to generate the complete as well as selective library.	

You can also start with the [codepen template](https://codepen.io/p5js/pen/wreBKy). You may need to update the version of the p5.js library that is linked into the html section.
